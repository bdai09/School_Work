Reflection: 

From this workshop, I practiced to design and code composition objects, where I understood the has-a relationship between classes.
Beside, I learned how to read in records and test components in string as well as using string functions to parse a string object into components.
Moreover, coding move constructor and move assignment operator reviewed my knowledge from previous chapters.
Lastly, by using array of pointers, I enhanced my understanding of using pointers.
