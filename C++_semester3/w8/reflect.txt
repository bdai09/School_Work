Reflection: 


In this workshop, I created a program component of quadratic complexity by extracting data from description structure and price structure and put into list vector of product struction
Through using raw pointer and smart pointer, I compared how to move an object,how to dynamically allocate memory, and learned how ownership works with smart pointer. I need to use either std::move() or use & for pointer to avoid ownership issue.
