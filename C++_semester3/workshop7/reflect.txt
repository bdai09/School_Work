Reflection: 

In this workshop, I learned how to read file and copy data into a sequential container, where I practice how to use container functions such as push_back.
Besides, through coding total value, mean value, median value, and standard deviation, I practiced how to use STL's numeric library functions, such as accumulate, inner_product, and transform.
I applied lambda expression in numeric library function calculation, which simplified the code and performed the logic.
Lastly, I used sort function in STL's algorithm to sort copied data and got the median value.
